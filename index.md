# Introduction
People are on a continual mine for wealth searching for the next biggest phenom in order to
jump that bandwagon earlier than sooner. The most recent phenomenon that has been taking
the world by storm is crypto. From Bitcoin to Squid coin the world of crypto is
continually expanding rapidly however many people are stuck in the unknown when trying to
determine what crypto to invest into. Rather than base decisions solely on impulsivity some
buyers may choose to seek rational advice from an external source such as social media. If they
however seek external help they are left in a difficult decision of trusting information being
echoed through media platforms. Our project will tackle the above by attempting to show a
relationship between the value of low-valued crypto currencies and their popularity on multiple
subreddits. We will also analyze if reddit is reactive or proactive in terms of cryptocurrencies and
for which currency is it proactive and reactive.

# Research Questions 

1. What is the relationship between popularity of coin’s mentioned on reddit and value of
coins in the real world for low valued bitcoins?
2. Does a surge in popularity due to posts and comments on reddit map to increases in
value for certain cryptocurrencies?
3. Can specific subreddits predict increases in value based on increases in popularity
through posts/comments?
4. What crypto that is most and least talked about through crypto subreddit?
5. Do surges in popularity on reddit map directly to the volume of transactions made per
cryptocurrency?
6. Do surges in popularity on reddit and twitter map directly to the volume of transactions
and price increase made per cryptocurrency?


# Data Collection 
## Crypto Data 
Data about names and symbols of crypto's were gathered first from website CoinMarketCap. This was data was craped from the web page and then parsed as needed. 

## Reddit Data 
Data was gathered from both posts and comments which were filtered based on whether they contained the name or symbol of crypto's discovered in our crypto data.
