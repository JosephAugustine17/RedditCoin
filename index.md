## Welcome to Reddit Coin

### Introduction
People are on a continual mine for wealth searching for the next biggest phenom in order to
jump that bandwagon earlier than sooner. The most recent phenomenon that has been taking
the world by storm is crypto. From Bitcoin to Squid coin the world of crypto is
continually expanding rapidly however many people are stuck in the unknown when trying to
determine what crypto to invest into. Rather than base decisions solely on impulsivity some
buyers may choose to seek rational advice from an external source such as social media. If they
however seek external help they are left in a difficult decision of trusting information being
echoed through media platforms. Our project will tackle the above by attempting to show a
relationship between the value of low-valued crypto currencies and their popularity on multiple
subreddits. We will also analyze if reddit is reactive or proactive in terms of cryptocurrencies and
for which currency is it proactive and reactive.
